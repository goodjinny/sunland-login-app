# Symfony login application
  
A test applications demonstrates basic form authentication according to the next logic:
- Needs a login to access the pages. 
- token or cookie needs to be saved so user doesnâ€™t have to login at every reload. 
- token or cookie needs to be validated by the backend on every reload. 
- user should be redirected away from pages if the token or cookie has expired.
